GP32 Linux Bootloader
---------------------

How to use it
-------------
Compile and store boot.fxe inside your 'gpmm\' directory. The
bootloader will look for a directory called 'gpmm\linux\', where
both 'zimage26' and 'initrd' files must be stored.
If you're considering compiling it by hand, I'd recommend you to
fetch a toolchain from DevKitARM and use it. Ask on the GP32
forums for help or ask us at #gp32dev on irc.efnet.net.
