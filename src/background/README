How to convert a BMP to gp32_sprite format ?

1) Use the bmp2bin tool, to convert the *.bmp to *.raw data.
./bmp2bin -x garfield.bmp garfield.raw
The -x means, that the Width and Height are written to the header.
gp_drawSpriteHT, needs this Format (-x)

2) Convert the *.raw file to a *.c file.
./convert garfield.raw > garfield.c

3) Edit the *.c file and change the name of the [] array.
unsigned char wasteland[] = { 66,7,.....
to
unsigned char garfield[] = { 66,7,......
