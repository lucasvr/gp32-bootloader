The zImage decompression code will ensure it is not going to overwrite the compressed data. If the kernel detects such a conflict it will uncompress the image immediately after the compressed zImage data and relocate the kernel after decompression. This obviously has the impact that the memory region the zImage is loaded into must have up to 4Megabytes of space after it (the maximum uncompressed kernel size), i.e. placing the zImage in the same 4Megabyte bank as its ZRELADDR would probably not work as expected.
